How to run my code
```python3 doublePenduluum.py```
```python3 TriplePenduluum.py```
```python3 quadPenduluum```

Results
The triple penduluum is extremly sensitive to perturbations!! Don't beleive me? Run my code and see how quickly slight diffrences in the initial conditions leads to very diffrent trajectories.

Add T_0_Image

T_1_Second_Image

T_2_Second_Image

A really awesome surprise was how cool the trajectory plotted over time looked! Heres a pic. This could realy make for a cool screensaver
